# shopping-list-mern
My first MERN application built by following [Traversy Media's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE)

Packaged is a simple shopping list app created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS)

# Setup:
1. run "npm install"
2. run "npm run dev"

Open up your browser and navigate to localhost:3000/ and you're there!
